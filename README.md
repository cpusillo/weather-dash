This is a weather app that will allow the user to view the current and upcoming weather conditions of a city of their choice!

Once a city has been selected, the temperature for the day will load and the 5 day forecast will load underneath. You can toggle between Celsius (metric) and Fahrenheit (imperial) from the right side of the navigation menu.
