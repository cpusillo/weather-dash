This is a weather dashboard app that allows the user to select a pre-provided city from the list, or enter their own city!

Once a city has been selected, the temperature for the day will load and the 5 day forecast will load underneath.

## How to use this app
* The application pre-loads a city for you.
* Enter a new city name in the search bar and hit "Submit"
* You can change from Fahrenheit to Celsius by selecting the radio button and re-submitting your city name
* The main display shows the current date's weather conditions
* The 5 Day Forecase shows the temperature and humidity for the next 5 days.

**Here's how the site looks**
